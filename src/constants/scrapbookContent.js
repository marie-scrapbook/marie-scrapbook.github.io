There were 5 real Ames Sisters and one of them, she got married and she got pregnant so they had all these bills to fill. They had been in the business a long time, the mother, the father were the managers, and the mother made the costumes. So they had to fill the bill that they had contracted for. So Hansi said take her; I was pretty much the same size. I looked something like some of them. So they put me in the costumes and taught me the routines and I was an Ames sister.",
