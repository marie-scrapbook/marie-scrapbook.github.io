So I went to dancing school and these were my first teachers: The Miller Sisters. Paula and Madeline. Madeline was the dancing teacher and Paula was the [piano] teacher. Patricia took lessons from Paula. I must have stayed with them until 8th grade at school, because then I opened my own school.'

Patricia was the pianist. This is our backyard in Elmhurst. Ann tap danced but... she knew everything, she was a pain in the neck so we threw her out. I don't think she liked it. I wound up with like 100. It snowballed. Because it was 25Â¢ a lesson. When I look back now, it must have hurt the Miller Sisters. This was a time when Shirley Temple was starting to come up. Everyone wanted a Shirley Temple."
