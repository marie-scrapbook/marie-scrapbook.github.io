      "Plenty of acts going around. Mostly at Christmas show they'd repeat. If it was a good Christmas show they'd bring that back again. Same as your [Radio City] Music Hall Christmas show, you know, they do the wooden soldiers act? If we had a good act at Christmastime, maybe they'd skip a couple of years and they'd bring it back again. We used to play a lot of midgets. You know, the toy boys."

There were a lot of people buying them. I think there were $17.95 and then we'd charge $20, $25, I don't remember. But that's what we did on Saturday night. But when all the lights come on and all the girls came out in the aisles. The excitement, yeah. So that's what we did for the war."
