So we go over there at lunch time. We all have full makeup on becauase you can't take your makeup off between shows, it's too hard to get on again. Too long. And I was too tall and too short. I was too short for the show girls and they have what they call a Pony Line, which is a little kick routine, and I was too tall for that. But we got the giggles anyhow.",

That was one of my jobs– go down there. I hated that job. Afraid of rats and everything. Haha! As a matter-of-fact, down there, if you entered on one side of the stage and then exited on the other, and had to get back on again for a routine? We had to go downstairs and run all the way through the basement and come up the other way. We couldn't get behind the curtains because there used every space of it."

World War 1?] Yeah. [Really?] Yeah. [He was in WWI?] Oh yeah. They were married in 1918 – when was the war over? [1917, 1918] Ok, so he came down in ‘17, the war was over in ‘18, I think. They were married in ‘18. He was in uniform when they were married, so the war was still on, yeah. [What kind of ship was he on? Do you know?] No, because he was a yeoman, which is all book work, he was down at the Whitehall building at the end of New York, down by Battery Place.
