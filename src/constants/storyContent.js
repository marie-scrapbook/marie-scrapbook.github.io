      "Plenty of acts going around. Mostly at Christmas show they'd repeat. If it was a good Christmas show they'd bring that back again. Same as your [Radio City] Music Hall Christmas show, you know, they do the wooden soldiers act? If we had a good act at Christmastime, maybe they'd skip a couple of years and they'd bring it back again. We used to play a lot of midgets. You know, the toy boys."

      "I know what I wanted to tell you. Is this on? I wanted to tell you that we went out every Saturday night in the audience. Saturday night house lights come on and we'd be in whatever outfit we were gonna wear that's cute, you, know. And we go out in the audience and we sold war bonds. Pledges. Every Saturday night. There were a lot of people buying them. I think there were $17.95 and then we'd charge $20, $25, I don't remember. But that's what we did on Saturday night. But when all the lights come on and all the girls came out in the aisles. The excitement, yeah. So that's what we did for the war."

      "At one time 3 of us got together, we had no rehearsals so let's go try and they're hiring at the Latin Quarter. Copacabana I think it was. So we all went there at lunch times in full makeup– of course you can't take your makeup off between shows, it's hard to get off. Too long. And I was too tall and too short. I was too short for the show girls and they have what they call a Pony Line, which is a little kick routines, and I was too tall for that. Just something to do. Oh a lot of people looked at us. We have these big eyelashes on. There were a lot of nice clubs. Lot of nice clubs.",

There's a special machine, and he learned that. He was working in the courts. In Maine. Oh yeah. He was a maine-iac. Haha. Then he joined the Navy and came back to New York. They were married in 1918 - when was the war over? He came down in 17, the war was over in 18, they were married in 18. He was in uniform when they were married, so the war was still on. Because he was a yeoman, which is all book work, he was down at the Whitehall building at the end of New York, by Battery Park. He never went to the ocean."
