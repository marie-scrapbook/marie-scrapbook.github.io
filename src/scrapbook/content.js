      'When I was about 8 years old, I was a sickly kid, so the doctor said "Send her to dancing school to build her up". So I went to dancing school and these were my first teachers: The Miller Sisters. Paula and Madeline. Madeline was the dancing teacher and Paula was the [piano] teacher. Patricia took lessons from Paula. I must have stayed with them until 8th grade at school, because then I opened my own school.'
